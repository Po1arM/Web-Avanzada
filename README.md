# Advanced Web Development Class Assignments: Microservices and Distributed systems
 
# Contents:
## Practice 2: 
Made a [mocky](https://designer.mocky.io/) clone. A mock API service that helps front-end developers simulate APIs so they don't have to wait around if the back-end service isn't ready yet. <br>

## Practice 3: 
Added persistance with a Postgres database to the previous assignment and containerized the services with Docker/Docker Compose<br>

## Practice 4:
Message queue service implementation<br>

## Practice 5:
Added Proxy / Load Balancering servers to the mock API app.<br>

## Practice 6:
Implemented and deployed serverless functions<br>

##Final Proyect: 
The goal was to integrate and deploy a complex microservice architecture web app. in other words, most of the web app itself was given and our job was to configure everything and deploy it.
The project implements:
* perimetral server
* users microservice with its own database
* service discovery and registry with eureka server
* config file hosting server
* mail microservice
* events microservice
* logs service
* system visualization with Kibana
* Java Web App

On every assignment, every service was containerized with Docker and Docker Compose and deployed in the cloud using AWS EC2 and Lambda
